    The World Wide Web (WWW), also called the Web, is an information space where documents
    and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked
    by hypertext links, and accessible via the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee
    invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while
    employed at CERN in Switzerland. The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to
    other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the
    Internet in August 1991.
