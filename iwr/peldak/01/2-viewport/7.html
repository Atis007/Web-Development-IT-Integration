          "only screen" → targets screen devices (the "only" keyword is optional).
          "(orientation: landscape)" → applies when the screen is wider than it is tall.
          "(min-width: 320px)" and "(max-width: 767px)" → restricts this rule
            to small screens such as smartphones (roughly 320–767 px wide).

          Together:
          → The body background changes to lightblue only when
            the device is in landscape mode AND the width is between 320px and 767px.

          "only" is a legacy keyword; it's not required in modern browsers.

    Resize the browser window or rotate your device.
    When the orientation is landscape <strong>and</strong> the screen width is between 320px and 767px,
    the background color becomes <strong>lightblue</strong>.
    Otherwise, it remains <strong>lightgreen</strong>.

    Orientation test: <em>portrait</em> or <em>landscape</em> (try rotating your phone or tablet).
