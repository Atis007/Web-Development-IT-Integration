      META VIEWPORT TAG
      -----------------
      The <meta name="viewport"> tag controls how a webpage is displayed and scaled on different devices.

      Before smartphones and tablets, web pages were designed for large desktop screens
      and often had fixed widths. When viewed on smaller screens, they appeared zoomed out and tiny.

      The viewport meta tag tells the browser how to control the page's dimensions and scaling
      so that the layout fits properly on all devices.

      Common properties:

        width=device-width
          → sets the viewport width equal to the physical device’s width (in CSS pixels).

        initial-scale=1
          → defines the default zoom level when the page is first loaded (1 means no zoom).

        user-scalable=yes
          → allows users to zoom in and out (for accessibility). “no” disables zooming,
            which violates Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

        height=device-height
          → rarely used; browsers calculate height automatically.

        minimum-scale / maximum-scale
          → control the minimum and maximum zoom levels (values between 0.1 and 10).
          → limiting zoom (especially setting maximum-scale=1 or user-scalable=no)
            is discouraged for accessibility reasons.

      Best practice:
      --------------
      Always use:  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
      and let responsive CSS handle layout changes for different screen sizes.
