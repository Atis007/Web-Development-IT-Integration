      -----------------
      This line controls how the page fits and scales on different devices.

        width=device-width
          → makes the page width match the physical screen width of the device.

        minimum-scale=0.5
          → allows the user to zoom out to 50% of the normal size.
            (The page can appear smaller if the user pinches to zoom out.)

        user-scalable=yes
          → allows zooming in and out, which is important for accessibility.

      Note:
      No "initial-scale" is defined, so the browser assumes the default (usually 1.0).

          MEDIA QUERY – orientation: landscape
          ------------------------------------
          This rule is applied when the device is in landscape orientation
          (the width is greater than the height).

          "only" is optional — it was used to hide media queries from very old browsers.
          Modern browsers understand @media screen, so "only" is not required anymore.
